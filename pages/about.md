    <h1 class="h1">Meet the Author and Illustrator, <br> Hardi Shukla</h1> <br> 
<p style="font-family: 'Nunito', sans-serif;">Growing up, Hardi never let go of her love for drawing, what started as a childhood habit became a lifelong practice for expressing the world. With her engineering background, she brings a technical eye to her illustrations, infusing them with a sense of precision and accuracy.
<br>
<br>
Her cultural roots in Gujarat also play a significant role in her style, often reflected through traditional motifs and thoughtful details.
<br><br>
Hardi regularly collaborates with a wide range of clients across the globe—from children’s magazines and educational platforms to storytelling—providing illustration, book cover design, STEM-illustrations and comic design. Her past collaborations include projects with the Champak magazine, Pratilipi, Pocket FM, Wonder Yonder, Playtos Miniversity, and the Green Literature Festival.</p>

        I had the pleasure of working with Hardi on a number of illustration heavy projects. Hardi was able to quickly adapt to various illustration style based on the requirement and was also very prompt with delivering the final files. She was always available on calls and texts for discussions. She is very creative and reliable. Hardi's help came at a crucial time when my startup was in its nascent stages and I am extremely happy I got to work with her and hope to continue working with her on future projects as well. I highly recommend Hardi to anyone looking for talented illustrators and visual designers.

    Illustrations in a children's book are work of art that not only adorn the walls of libraries but also light up the imagination of children in ways more than we can imagine, We love so many fictional characters just because of the brilliant work done while illustrating them. Hardi Shukla and her scrawled notions bring to life many such stories and make our minds as colorful as her illustrations. We have thoroughly enjoyed working with Hardi and admire her professionalism and her push towards perfection with every page, every single line. She captures every single thought that an author puts in words. Abhimanyu's What is on the dark side of the Moon?" is a brilliant example of this.

Great Team Player! I had worked with Hardi on two of my books and she is very cooperative. Easy to work with and very creative. She understands the requirements and works to give her best to the task. She is never shy to redo the task any number of times. This attitude of hers makes it very easy to work with her. Always on time and gives nothing but the best.
