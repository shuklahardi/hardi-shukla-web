    <h2>Illustrating process of The Holi Bet story</h2>

    <p>Illustrating a story is more than just drawing—it’s about shaping characters, emotions, and moods that enhance storytelling. Instead of keeping this process behind the scenes, it has been documented and shared to offer insight into how illustrations take shape step by step.</p>
    
    <p>From understanding the story and characters to refining expressions, composition, and colors, each stage was thoughtfully designed to bring the story to life. This story was featured in <strong>Champak Magazine</strong>, making the process even more special! Creating for a publication that has been a part of so many childhoods was truly a rewarding experience.</p>
    
    <h2>Understanding the Story & Characters</h2>
    <p>The characters in the story were animals and birds, each with a distinct personality. The goal was to visually differentiate them not just in terms of species but also through body language, expressions, and gestures that reflected their nature.</p>

    <h2>Sketching, Composition & Expressions</h2>
    <p>Once the characters were well understood, rough sketches were created to explore various compositions that balanced storytelling and visual appeal.</p>

    <h2>Inking Part</h2>
    <p>After finalizing rough sketches and composition, the inking and rendering process began. A calligraphy stroke ink pencil was used to maintain clean lines, enhancing clarity while keeping the illustrations smooth. The balance between detail and simplicity ensured that the focus remained on the characters and their emotions.</p>

    <h2>Color Palette & Mood</h2>
    <p>Holi, being a festival of vibrant colors, required an energetic and festive visual treatment. A warm and cheerful palette dominated by yellows, pinks, blues, and greens was chosen to reflect the joy of the occasion.</p>

    <h2>Special attention was given to</h2>
    <p>Shadows and highlights to maintain depth while keeping a lighthearted feel. Small storytelling elements in the background to add richness without distracting from the main nerrative.</p>

    <p>Illustrating "The Holi Bet" was not just about creating visuals but about bringing the essence of the festival and the characters' emotions to life. Through each stroke of color and line, the goal was to capture warmth, laughter, and the heartfelt message of friendship and respect.</p>
