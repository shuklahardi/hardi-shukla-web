After a lot of listening, speaking, observing, chatting, and getting inspired by the culture I proudly grew up in, I created a sticker pack for the all sweet and ચોખ્ખા બોલી Gujaratis.

<h3>From Sketchbook to Stickers</h3>
It all began with rough pencil sketches (see image) – character studies filled my notebooks as I captured expressions inspired by daily conversations at home and dramatic dialogues. I focused on exaggerating gestures, eyes, and postures to keep the tone playful, loud, and real.

<h3>Bringing Gujarati Expressions to Life</h3>
I started curating common phrases – “આવતા રહેવું”, “ચાકાચક”, “સરસ!”, “બકવાસ!” – and imagined the tone and face behind each. These weren’t just translations. They were vaato – full of flavour, sass, humour, and warmth.

<h3>Adding Colour, Culture & Character</h3>
Once I was happy with the black-and-white drafts, I moved on to digital inking and colouring. The pink and green colours are commonly seen in the clothes of vibrant Gujaratis.
