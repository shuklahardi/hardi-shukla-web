Reading a beautiful book on oceans made me want to create something inspired by that feeling. 

I thought—what’s around us often and can carry that calm ocean vibe? Coasters felt perfect. You use them often, and if they remind you of the sea while having your morning tea, there’s no better way to start the day—fresh, light, and quietly uplifting.

There’s a line I kept thinking of — we carry the ocean inside us. That idea shaped the entire mood of the collection.

Initial ideas were mapped as storyboards, showing the connection between thoughts, feelings, and ocean imagery.

The vast ocean palette—from sunlit golds to deep blues—was explored in sketches to evoke specific emotional experiences.

Final colors were chosen to represent layered moods—each coaster stands for a unique emotional and oceanic identity.

Gill Sans was chosen for its clarity and timelessness — complementing the soothing and universal tone of the coasters.

Material, shape, and finish were thoughtfully selected to balance beauty, durability, and table-friendly design.

These coasters are printed on acrylic with smooth edges. The design is made to feel thoughtful but not fragile—something beautiful that also fits into daily use.
