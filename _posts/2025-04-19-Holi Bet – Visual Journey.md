Illustrating a story is more than just drawing—it’s about shaping characters, emotions, and moods that enhance storytelling. 

From understanding the story & characters to expressions, composition, and colors, this breakdown captures how illustrations take shape step by step. This story was featured in Champak Magazine, making the process even more special! Creating for a publication that has been a part of so many childhoods was truly a rewarding experience.

<h3>Understanding the Story & Characters</h3>
The characters in the story were animals and birds, each with a distinct personality. The goal was to visually differentiate them not just in terms of species but also through body language, expressions, and gestures that reflected their nature.

<h3>Sketching & Composition</h3>
Once the characters were well understood, rough sketches were created to explore various compositions that balanced storytelling and visual appeal.

<h3>Inking Part</h3>
After finalizing rough sketches and composition, the inking and rendering process began. A calligraphy stroke ink pencil was used to maintain clean lines, enhancing clarity while keeping the illustrations smooth. The balance between detail and simplicity ensured that the focus remained on the characters and their emotions.

<h3>Colour Palette and Mood</h3>
Holi, being a festival of vibrant colors, required an energetic and festive visual treatment. A warm and cheerful palette dominated by yellows, pinks, blues, and greens was chosen to reflect the joy of the occasion.
