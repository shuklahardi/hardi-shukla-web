This tote bag was about capturing that busy, colorful feel of an Indian street market—people moving, talking, bargaining.

I walked through bazaars with my sketchbook, drawing people on the move. These drawings helped me notice little details—like how shopkeepers gesture or how buyers lean in.

While choosing the color palette for the tote bag, I wanted it to feel as vibrant and lively as an actual Indian bazaar. But at the same time, I also wanted the bag—and the person carrying it—to stand out in that crowd. It’s bold, colorful, and designed to blend in just enough while still turning heads.

The final design builds on those sketches with bright colors and a crowded composition. It’s my way of preserving the charm of local markets on something as simple as a tote.
