It is a self-published illustrated book that talks openly and positively about periods. 


I created it to make the topic less awkward and more accessible, especially for young readers. It’s available on Amazon and is designed to be a friendly guide—something that answers questions, offers support, and encourages open conversations.

The content is friendly and straightforward, mixing facts with drawings. I wanted it to feel like a guide and a safe space at the same time.

The tone of the book is supportive. It gives space to ask questions, learn, and feel okay with something that’s natural and important.
