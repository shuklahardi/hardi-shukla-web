<p>Illustrating a story is more than just drawing—it’s about shaping characters, emotions, and moods that enhance storytelling. Instead of keeping this process behind the scenes, it has been documented and shared to offer insight into how illustrations take shape step by step.</p>

<p>From understanding the story and characters to refining expressions, composition, and colors, each stage was thoughtfully designed to bring the story to life. This story was featured in Champak Magazine, making the process even more special! Creating for a publication that has been a part of so many childhoods was truly a rewarding experience.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Story &amp; Characters</h2>
<p>The characters in the story were animals and birds, each with a distinct personality. The goal was to visually differentiate them not just in terms of species but also through body language, expressions, and gestures that reflected their nature.</p>
